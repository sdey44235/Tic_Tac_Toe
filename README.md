The Tic-Tac-Toe game project is a classic implementation of the popular two-player strategy game, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows players to engage in a simple, yet engaging experience where they alternate marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The game features a clean and responsive user interface, styled with CSS, while JavaScript handles the game logic, including turn management and win detection. This project not only offers a fun gaming experience but also serves as an excellent introduction to web development and interactive programming.
